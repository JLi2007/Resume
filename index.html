                <p>My name is James Li, and I'm going into eleventh grade at Laurel Heights Secondary School in Waterloo. Coming from an Asian background, I was taught early on that a successful future is built day-by-day by academics. The problem was that, though I always did excellent in school and always achieved high grades, I was lost when it came to my future. I love setting goals for myself, but when it came to my future, I felt stuck, like there was nothing for me to build towards. This all changed when I got more into CS. I took the Grade 11 CS course in the second semester of Grade 10, and all the wires connected one-by-one in my brain from there. My heavy interest, mixed with my strong hunger to learn, gave me something to finally work towards. The list is getting bigger by the month, but now I know Python, C, HTMl, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. It has been a great journey so far, but I am nowhere near the end. One huge regret I have is how many opportunities I have missed out on. Growing up, I was a quiet kid; thus, I did not have the confidence to join many clubs, groups, or participate in many events. This still partly shows today, as when it comes to larger groups and talking in front of a lot of people, I still struggle a bit. Around the start of 2023, when I finally realised the value of opportunities and I started signing up for many different types of events and groups, many of which I will talk about later in my resume. Though I wish I could have been more spontaneous and more open to things growing up, the past cannot be changed, and what is crucial now is for me to continue participating in events and in larger groups. </p>

SVP teens raised $5000 dollars for communities in the Waterloo Region last year, and we plan on doubling that for 2023/2024! At SVP teens, strong collaboration and communication skills are required, as well as the ability to problem solve using efficient metheods and impulsive decision making. </p>

                <div class="description"> At Royal City Soccer Camp, I coached soccer for two weeks, helping kids with a passion for soccer improve on their skills. Since I am a soccer player myself, I gave valuable advice and ran purposeful drills during the camp sessions.

My student struggled deeply in English; mainly spelling and writing. I was able to teach, and gave effective exercises to help him improve. In the end, there was a huge difference in quality between his first assignment and final assignment; hence my teaching was extremely succesful. </div>

                <p>High School Hacks was a virtual hackathon that ran during 48 hours late May. I, hearing about this interesting opportunity, decided to join in with three friends to create a game. This was obviously all new to me, but I got used to the workload and expectations right from the tip, and got to work. It was during the Hackathon where I got introduced to HTML and CSS; as we decided to host the game on a custom website. Sadly, we did not win the Hackathon, but the knowledge I gained from it was well worth the time and effort. Hack the 6ix would be my second Hackathon, and I am greatly determined to learn even more, and perhaps achieve results this time!</p>

                <p>My friends and I are participating in RhythmHacks in early September! Though it is considered to be on the smaller side, it will be my first in-person Hackathon. I am excited as I have learned a lot since the previous Hackathon I have participated in (HighSchoolHacks) and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to showcase my new knowledge whilst further sharpening my rapidly growing skillset.</p>

                <div class="Thequote">"Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do" - Bruce Lee </div>
                <p>Anyone can learn, but applying the information that one has gathered is just as important; because otherwise, the compelling and deep knowledge gained will all eventually go to waste. Similarly, anyone can plan, or even express that they would like to work, but nothing would matter unless actual work is done. To me, this quote expresses the overlooked value of simply taking tasks hands-on instead of overthinking the details.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <div class="Thequote">"It's not whether you get knocked down, its whether you get up." - Vince Lombardi </div>
                <p>I think this motivational quote speaks for itself. It's okay to be knocked down by somebody else, it's okay to disappoint yourself, it's okay to make plenty of mistakes every day. It is how one rebounds from these situations that determines the outcome. Two decisions present themselves in these situations: quickly move on, or learn from whatever the problem was, then moving on. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <div class="Thequote">"Victory is reserved for those who are willing to pay its price." - Sun Tzu</div>
                <p>To be victorious, one must earn it. There are many ways one can interpret this, but to me, I see it from two perspectives. Playing rep soccer and now being involved in larger groups such as SVP teens, victory means achieving OUR goals, not just mine. So to earn it, collaboration is crucial. On the other hand, small victories must be won every single day to achieve success in the long run, "finishing my to-do list", or even "Finish my Resume Website" are great examples of my intriguing daily victories (which have not been won yet today, but we don't talk about that). </p>

            <div class="starting">It's the experience that counts.</div>
            <p>Early in the summer, two of my friends presented me an idea: Creating a print-on-demand shirt business. Being open to new things, I agreed, as I also have the ability to create all the designs with my Photoshop skills; which I did. We all put in some effort in our spare time, and we all have different roles, but my role at the moment are creating designs, and some other less intriguing tasks such as research a relatively small role in marketing. Teamwork is key to a business. We recently hit the market, and we have one sale so far. We are only in the early stages, but I believe we have potential to make it further than we expect. Though we are hoping to grow by using different techniques in marketing and business related ways, I think the main takeaway from this experience isn't money, or anything like that, but what I learn from it. Our company is ZonneCanada on Etsy. </p>

Since I was born in raised in Canada, I am obviously fluent in English. My parents were immigrants from China, and my grandparents live with us, thus I am highly fluent in Mandarin, I just can't read and write fully. I attended Chinese School until last year, and even obtained a high school credit for grade 9. For French, I just recently dropped French immersion to pursue more important courses.</p>

                <p>I played soccer since I was 5. Now, I play rep soccer for Waterloo, and I am even the captain of the team and our star player, because of my strong communication skills and my talent. On top of that, I was a starter for my school's soccer team that won our regional league (WCSSAA). I also play basketball for fun with friends; however, I have never played for a team before. I also go on a run every day to boost stamina and to be more active. I plan on joining the cross country running team at school next year. </p>

                <p>Like the stereotypes claim, I do also play the piano. I started when I was 6 years old, and I though I wasn't very passionate about practicing every single day, I eventually got to level 8 and finished my theory and practical exams in July of 2022. It was then, where my parents and I came to a mutual decision for me to stop playing for levels, but that does not stop me from enjoying the instrument. I feel like now, when I have the freedom to play the pieces that I decide to play and whenever I want, made me finally realize after so many years how great the Piano truly is. </p>

                <div>Design</div>
                <p> During Covid, one of my biggest passions was designing sports graphics on Photoshop, and by doing so, I developped skills and techniques to now use Photoshop confidently to create any pieces of art I need for school, my business that I previously explained, or even for this website; I made all the backgrounds you see here. At the peak of my designing, I got many offers for money from many people; however, I declined them all as I was not willing to commit a significant amount of time, since I always viewed designing as just a hobby. Though I'm not as passionate about sports design anymore because I put academic things ahead, I still sometimes create for fun.  https://www.instagram.com/jamatt_designs/ (@jamatt_designs) is my design instagram. </p>
